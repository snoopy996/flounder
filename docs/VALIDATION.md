# Product Validation

This document records the current product-validation state for Flounder as an
autonomous white-hat security auditor. It is a release-readiness note, not a
security disclosure or a claim that every target has been fully audited.

Validation source: the installed Flounder skill, the local Flounder control
plane, connected daemons, and current project state read through the REST API on
2026-06-23. The validation posture intentionally used neutral source and
official project materials. Known exploit writeups, incident explanations, and
answer-bearing material were not supplied as corpus.

## Environment

- Control plane reachable through the Flounder UI/API.
- Three execution daemons were online.
- No validation jobs were active when this report was written.
- At the 2026-06-23 validation snapshot, the default provider profile was
  `openai-codex · gpt-5.5 · xhigh`; daemon-local auth was required before live
  model work. Fresh stores now default to `openai-codex · gpt-5.6-sol · xhigh`;
  the validation results below remain the historical evidence from that dated
  snapshot rather than a claim that they were rerun with the newer model.
- Current source/material state is versioned by Prepare and Map boundaries; old
  findings and scopes remain inspectable as historical data but no longer count
  in the current project view after a newer Prepare or Map.

## Results

| Target | Prepare | Coverage | Current result | Validation status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Aztec public network, 2026-06-17 neutral target | Limited but audit-ready. Live Ethereum mainnet contracts and Aztec public RPC ground truth were collected with read-only guidance. | 115 scopes mapped, 5 audited, 110 pending. | 6 current findings: 3 locally confirmed, 2 real-target reproduced, 3 still suspected. Formal reports exist for reproduced findings. | Positive product validation. Flounder found and reproduced project-level governance/payload issues from neutral materials, but this target is not fully exhausted. |
| Aztec Connect, 2026-06-14 neutral target | Limited but audit-ready. Ethereum mainnet deployment, verified source, bridge adapters, and read-only fork guidance were collected. One unverified component remains a trust-boundary caveat. | 137 scopes mapped, 2 audited, 135 pending. | 3 locally confirmed findings. The critical `numRealTxs` finding was reproduced on the real target and has a report. Two medium findings remain unconfirmed on the real target. | Strong positive product validation for the target bug class. The key issue was found from neutral material and reproduced, but non-key findings still need confirm or dismissal. |
| Zcash Orchard / Halo2 neutral target | Limited but audit-ready. Source-provided packages and official specifications were staged; no live target confirmation is required. | 75 scopes mapped, 1 audited, 74 pending. | 0 current findings. The audited high-priority ECC scope discharged the relevant obligation because the prepared source uses the current anchored-base implementation. | Incomplete for historical recall. The product behaved correctly for the prepared current source, but this does not prove recall on the older historical source line. A neutral historical source pin is required to validate that specific recall case. |

## Zcash Historical Prepare Convergence

The current-source Zcash/Halo2 project is not the historical recall target. A
separate neutral historical-source Prepare was attempted on 2026-06-23 with
only official package/source material and no answer-bearing incident material.

Observed behavior:

- The model selected the nearest prior source line around `orchard 0.13.x` and
  `halo2_gadgets 0.4.x`, which is the right neutral direction for this
  validation.
- One run successfully staged crates.io source packages, but kept the early
  checkpoint manifest at `components: []` while continuing optional cleanup and
  documentation work. That is now treated as a product bug, not as an acceptable
  Prepare result.
- A second run with the stricter manifest guard still spent too long in
  dependency/version selection before source staging. It was stopped
  intentionally instead of letting validation drift into another long
  acquisition attempt.

Conclusion: the historical Zcash/Halo2 recall case should not be advanced by
re-running the same free-form Prepare prompt. The next product step is to give
Prepare a package-acquisition affordance for official source packages
(`crates.io` first, then equivalent npm/GitHub release paths later): resolve a
package/version, download and checksum the published archive, extract it into
the staged source tree, and return component rows the manifest can use. This
keeps Prepare autonomous while avoiding repeated ad hoc package scripts.

## Product Issues Found And Fixed

- Scope inventory projection now respects the latest Map boundary. Older scopes
  no longer leak into current project coverage after a remap.
- Running Audit no longer makes the project appear unmapped before its first
  scope checkpoint.
- Prepare refresh now resets downstream phase status in the UI instead of
  showing stale Verify, Confirm, Report, or Synthesis state.
- Read-only file-existence checks are allowed in the command policy.
- Live map checkpoints are surfaced before daemon ingest finishes.
- Prepare runs now fail closed when the terminal manifest has no source
  components, instead of presenting an empty manifest as done.
- Prepare now blocks optional work after source files are staged while
  `prepare_manifest.json` still has empty components, forcing a manifest refresh
  before the agent can continue.

## Release Readiness Assessment

Flounder is close to an open-source release candidate for users who want an
AI-driven audit loop that can:

- prepare source and official materials without answer-bearing corpus,
- map a scope inventory,
- audit selected scopes,
- verify suspected findings by execution,
- reproduce real-target findings with read-only/fork-safe confirmation, and
- generate one report per reproduced bug.

The validation is not complete enough to claim universal recall. The strongest
release-safe claim is narrower: Flounder successfully found and reproduced
material issues on the Aztec validation targets using neutral inputs, while the
Zcash/Halo2 historical recall case still needs an exact neutral historical
source target.

## Minimal Remaining Work

Before calling this validation complete:

1. Add a neutral historical-source Zcash/Halo2 validation target that pins the
   older source line without including the exploit explanation, incident
   conclusions, or answer-bearing material.
2. Run Prepare and Map on that pinned target, then audit the relevant mapped
   scope without injecting answer-bearing material.
3. Confirm whether the model independently rediscovers the issue, records a
   finding, and can produce executable evidence.
4. Add the package-acquisition affordance described above before retrying the
   Zcash historical Prepare; do not keep spending validation time on the same
   free-form acquisition loop.
5. For Aztec Connect, either confirm the two remaining medium findings or mark
   them as non-submittable with evidence.
6. For Aztec public network, keep the current reproduced findings as positive
   product evidence, but do not claim full target coverage because 110 scopes
   remain pending.
