# Solidity And EVM Contract Audits

`configs/solidity-contract-audit.default.json` provides optional context for authorized Solidity and EVM smart-contract audits.

In audit mode, the profile is context, not a checklist. The agent still decides what to read, suspect, test, and report. Deterministic profiles, provenance facts, source indexes, and local seeders are planning aids only; findings must come from the agent and local evidence.

## What The Profile Adds

- Solidity/EVM project context for assets, authorities, trust boundaries, attacker capabilities, and invariants.
- Optional domain hints for authorization, governance, token accounting, share accounting, staking rewards, validator accounting, async settlement, callbacks, reentrancy, oracle manipulation, signatures, bridges, Wormhole, Hyperlane, slippage, risk configuration, upgradeability, liquidation, solvency, deployment, and dependency trust.
- Solidity provenance facts for externally callable functions, external calls, delegatecall, state writes, auth guards, signatures, oracle reads, upgrade hooks, token transfers, governance paths, name-service paths, bridge fields, and unchecked arithmetic.
- Foundry and Hardhat compatibility for local-only test execution under the shared command policy.

## Recommended Audit

```bash
fsa run \
  --config ./configs/solidity-contract-audit.default.json \
  --target protocol-contract-audit \
  --source <target>/src <target>/contracts \
  --corpus <target>/README.md <target>/docs <target>/specs \
  --provider openai \
  --model gpt-5.5 \
  --thinking xhigh \
  --map-steps 60 --dig-steps 60
```

For larger repositories, include the highest-signal specs, prior audits, test suites, deployment notes, and threat-model material as corpus input. The agent can choose when to search or read it.

## Local Reproduction

Reproduction is part of the audit: the agent calls `bash` to write and run local tests in the copied workspace, and a finding only becomes `confirmed-executable` when a `purpose=confirm` test passes. Commands are restricted to local test runners such as:

- `forge test`
- `npx hardhat test`

During `fsa run` the command policy blocks public-network broadcast, transfer, credential, persistence, and exploit-optimization flows. Public RPC URLs, public Hardhat networks, and arguments that reference RPC or secret environment variables are blocked. Use local Anvil, Hardhat, or isolated devnet endpoints.

## Open-World Confirmation

EVM is `fsa confirm`'s strongest path: a `forge test --fork-url <mainnet>` reproduces a finding against the **real deployed contract and its real configured components** at a chosen block. After a run, point confirm at it:

```bash
fsa confirm ./runs/protocol-contract-audit-<timestamp> \
  --source <target>/src --build-root <target> \
  --provider openai-codex
```

Confirm relaxes the policy to allow forking and reading a live chain (`--fork-url`, `cast call`, etc.), but still **never broadcasts**: a `cast send` / `forge script --broadcast` is blocked when its RPC target is non-local, so the exploit is replayed against the *local* fork, never the live chain. A finding is marked `reproduced` only if it triggers on the forked real target with attacker-real capabilities and an exhibited on-chain effect — which also execution-*refutes* findings whose `run` PoC only worked against a mocked verifier/proxy (the real component reverts or returns well-formed data).

## Input Checklist

Load as much source-backed context as possible:

- `src/`, `contracts/`, scripts, deployment libraries, generated address registries, and linked libraries.
- `foundry.toml`, `remappings.txt`, Hardhat configs, compiler settings, and dependency manifests.
- Protocol specs, whitepapers, docs, invariants, prior audits, known limitations, and threat-model notes.
- Fuzz, invariant, and unit tests as context. Tests are coverage evidence, not proof that a property is enforced.

For high-stakes audits, extend `projectContext` with exact protocol assets, roles, deployed components, upgrade model, oracle model, cross-chain assumptions, and out-of-scope components.
