// the (provably pristine, see baseline integrity) target source and re-run the
// SAME test. A real bug's test passes on the vulnerable code and is blocked once
// the fix lands; a tautological test behaves identically before and after, so it
// cannot reach confirmed-differential. The framework — never the model — applies
// the fix and judges the result.
