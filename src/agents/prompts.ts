- securityProperty: invariant that must hold
- failureMode: one allowed tag
- why: why this spot is worth checking
- specRefs: optional list of cited spec/reference snippets

Grounding rules:
- Enumerate only source-backed or corpus-backed items. If the loaded material does not show the file, function, manifest, route, contract, circuit, or API, do not create an item for it.
- Every item should point to the most specific visible location available. Prefer file:line-range locations from the loaded source.
- Treat missing manifests, tests, configs, docs, or entrypoints as unknown context, not as vulnerabilities or audit items, unless the loaded material explicitly makes their absence security-relevant.
- If only a narrow source excerpt is loaded, stay within that excerpt's observable language and domain. Do not infer a web/API/dependency audit surface from a standalone circuit, contract, library, or algorithm file.
- Use the initialization learning notes as source-backed hypotheses for what must be checked, but do not treat those notes as findings.
- Use machine-extracted proof obligations and provenance facts as attention-routing evidence only. They are not findings, and they are not sufficient to claim a bug.
${provenanceGuidance(input.provenanceFacts)}
- Derive security properties from the loaded material and configured high-level scope. Do not rely on memorized project-specific bug patterns.

Prioritize issues that match the project profile and evidence in the loaded material. Consider implementation/spec mismatch, trust-boundary mistakes, unenforced invariants, value conservation, replay or uniqueness failures, auth/session bugs, injection, SSRF, path traversal, deserialization, unsafe external calls, race conditions, consensus divergence, dependency trust, secret exposure, and cheap-to-trigger expensive work.

Portfolio rules:
- Treat the machine-extracted facts as routing evidence, not as findings.
- Prefer specific file:line-range items over broad module-wide items.
- Follow assigned or copied values into the visible checks, selectors, gates, equality relations, range checks, or state transitions that rely on them.
- When a downstream check relies on a caller-provided parameter, prior cell, copied value, lookup result, or other upstream value, create a separate item for that handoff instead of only checking repeated values or later arithmetic.
- For assignment facts, consider two distinct candidate shapes when the loaded material supports them: the upstream ingress into the assigned cell, and the downstream use of that assigned cell by checks. Do not collapse both into one broad loop or module item when the line evidence is specific.
- If an item only says checked cells are internally reused, locally equal, or consumed by gates, it does not cover the ingress item. Emit the ingress item separately when the upstream value is visible.
- Ingress items should name both sides of the edge: the checked cell or state being populated, and the caller argument, prior cell, copied cell, lookup result, external input, or state read it depends on.
- When the evidence supports ingress items, reserve roughly one third of the budget for ingress-only items. An ingress-only item should not be answerable solely by proving local equality or downstream consumption; it should require inspecting how an upstream value enters the checked cell or state.
- Prefer locations that include the assignment evidence line and the nearest visible check/use line, separated by semicolons if needed.
- If a fact is not security-relevant after reading the loaded source and reference material, skip it.
- Do not repeat broad items already implied by the general module purpose when a narrower dataflow edge is visible.
- Do not use memorized project-specific bug patterns; derive properties from the loaded material.

Audit reasoning rules:
- Ground every positive finding in exact source lines, visible checks, visible constraints, or a visible missing edge in data flow.
- Trace attacker-controlled or security-critical values through the relevant transformations, checks, constraints, state updates, and verifier or authorization decisions.
- State exactly what enforces the assigned security property, or identify the specific visible edge where enforcement is missing.
- Separate assignment-time computation from enforced checks: code that computes a value for a checked cell shows the honest path, but a conclusion still needs the visible equality, copy, constraint, lookup, or caller/callee edge that ties that cell to any upstream value the property relies on.
- If the assigned property depends on a caller-provided parameter, prior cell, copied value, lookup result, or other upstream value, do not treat local repetition or downstream arithmetic alone as proof; identify the visible handoff that connects the upstream value to the checked cells.
- If attackerControlledInputs names both upstream inputs and internal checked values, include the upstream-to-internal handoff in the audit even when the securityProperty wording is terse. Proving only local reuse, local equality, repeated state, or downstream arithmetic is not enough for that mixed-input item.

Depth rules:
- Prefer items that connect two pieces of evidence not checked together in prior rounds, such as input to enforcement edge, spec statement to implementation branch, authorization identity to storage predicate, or value/state transition to conservation check.
- Follow unresolved, low-confidence, or skeptical audit observations into adjacent code and data flow instead of re-auditing the same location.
- When a prior no-finding only shows that checked cells are consumed by local gates, local equality checks, or repeated computations, reserve a depth item for the immediate ingress edge into those cells: caller argument, prior cell, copy edge, lookup result, external input, or state read.
- If a prior finding depends on an assumption, enumerate the cheapest item that would refute or support that assumption.
- If the loaded source is narrow, stay within the visible source and reference material. Do not invent files, APIs, manifests, routes, dependencies, or deployment surfaces.
- Do not include an item if its normalized location, failure mode, and security property are already present in the existing checklist.
