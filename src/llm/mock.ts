The mock verifier confirms the candidate at source level for framework testing. A real verifier must inspect the target circuit and write a local unit test.

2. Confidence ladder

- Local gadget unit test that mutates the witness assignment.
- Component proof test in the target circuit.
- Local regtest/devnet end-to-end test if the component test confirms impact.

3. PoC scaffold

\`\`\`rust
// Local-only unit test scaffold. Do not run against testnet or mainnet.
#[test]
fn advice_assignment_must_be_constrained() {
    // Construct honest and malicious witness assignments and assert the malicious
    // assignment is rejected after the fix.
}

Replace unconstrained advice assignment with copy/equality-constrained assignment.`;
