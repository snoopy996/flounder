# `configs/` — opt-in domain profiles

These JSON files are **authored threat-model profiles**, one per common audit scenario:

| File | Scenario |
| --- | --- |
| `vulnerability-audit.default.json` | generic security audit (domain-agnostic) |
| `solidity-contract-audit.default.json` | Solidity / EVM smart contracts |
| `cairo-starknet-audit.default.json` | Cairo contracts, Starknet OS, StarkGate-style bridges |
| `zk-constraint-audit.default.json` | zero-knowledge / constraint-system circuits |
| `thegraph-contracts.default.json` | The Graph protocol contracts |

Each is a `projectContext` scaffold for that class — the kind of assets, attacker
capabilities, trust boundaries, invariants, and focus areas a known stack tends to have.

## Not used by default — and that's deliberate

The framework **never loads these on its own.** A default `flounder run` / `flounder map` /
`flounder audit` carries **no preset bug knowledge**: the run is blind and execution-grounded,
so the model has to enumerate the attack surface from the *actual* source before any
audit trial can find anything. Handing the model a pre-written list of where bugs usually
live biases it toward the listed areas and away from the unlisted, and risks turning the
audit into checklist-matching instead of reading. That is the opposite of how this tool is
meant to find novel bugs, so the profiles stay off unless you ask for them.

They exist for the cases where that trade-off is worth it: a **well-trodden vulnerability
class** where seeding the common surface is genuinely useful, a **capped budget** that
needs a head start on focus/out-of-scope, or **quickly framing scope** for a familiar
stack. In those situations, opt in:

```bash
flounder run --config ./configs/solidity-contract-audit.default.json \
        --target my-protocol --source ./contracts --corpus ./docs
```

## What a profile actually changes

`--config <file>` merges into the run config (`applyConfigOverrides`), then **command-line
flags override it** — so `--target` / `--source` / `--corpus` / `--max-steps` you pass on
the CLI win over the file. From `projectContext`, only **`summary`, `focusAreas`, and
`outOfScope`** currently reach the model (woven into its scope note). The richer fields
below are **documentation/scaffold today** — they record the threat model for a human
author but are not yet injected into the prompt.

```jsonc
{
  "targetName": "…",
  "sourcePaths": [],          // usually left empty; pass the real target via --source
  "corpusPaths": [],          // usually left empty; pass the project's own docs via --corpus
  "thinkingLevel": "xhigh",
  "projectContext": {
    "summary": "…",            // ── injected into the model's scope note
    "focusAreas": ["…"],       // ── injected
    "outOfScope": ["…"],       // ── injected
    "criticalAssets": ["…"],         // scaffold only (declared, not yet prompted)
    "attackerCapabilities": ["…"],   // scaffold only
    "trustBoundaries": ["…"],        // scaffold only
    "securityInvariants": ["…"],     // scaffold only
    "scenarioGuidance": ["…"]        // scaffold only
  }
}
```

Leave `sourcePaths` / `corpusPaths` empty in the profile and pass the **real** target and
the **project's own** specs/docs on the command line. A profile is a frame, not a
substitute for the target's actual material.

## The line a profile must not cross

A profile is **context, never a verdict.** It may tell the model where to look; it may not
tell the model what it will find. Confirmation still comes only from execution — a finding
is real because a PoC ran, never because it matched a profile. (The profiles' own
`scenarioGuidance` says it outright: "Do not write static bug rules that claim findings.")

## Extending this directory

This is the opt-in home for **domain knowledge packs**. To add one, keep it generic to a
*class* and **answer-free**: capture the attack surface and invariants a class tends to
have, never a specific known bug in a specific target. Anything target-specific belongs in
that audit's `--corpus`, not here.
