  Operates Flounder, an autonomous white-hat security auditor. Use when a user
  asks for a security audit, bug-bounty review, vulnerability investigation, or
  exploit proof for a public-source or authorized repository, source tree, package, smart
  contract, Solidity/EVM project, ZK or proof-system code, deployed address,
  transaction, project link, or prior Flounder run; to run Flounder prepare,
  map, dig, audit, verify, confirm, or report workflows; to configure Flounder server,
  daemon, provider profiles, model auth, sandboxed execution, corpus paths,
  source paths, build roots, coverage, or budgets; to monitor live audit activity, continue
  pending scopes, verify suspected vulnerabilities, reproduce findings, or
  collect execution-backed bug reports.

# Flounder

This skill is the operating manual for Flounder-driven security audits.

Flounder is an autonomous white-hat security auditor. The agent prepares the
target, audits source, constructs exploit paths, runs local proof tests,
confirms real findings, and packages reports. The framework provides the
daemon, sandbox, command policy, run tracking, live activity, and execution
gates.

## Skill Files

| File | When to read |
| --- | --- |
| `SKILL.md` | Always after this skill triggers. It is the operating playbook. |
| `reference/commands.md` | Exact CLI, REST, provider, daemon, budget, output, and pi extension details. |
| `reference/examples.md` | Concrete Solidity/EVM and ZK examples. |
| `reference/product.md` | Dashboard, project lifecycle, run phases, tracking, and artifact model. |
| `reference/safety.md` | White-hat policy, sandbox boundary, evidence ladder, and public-release hygiene. |

Use progressive disclosure: open only the reference file needed for the current
task. Do not duplicate long command references into the conversation when a
short command and status summary is enough.

## What This Skill Must Do

- Turn a security-audit request into a public-source or authorized Flounder project or run.
- Keep the operator on the current workflow: `run <clue>` lets Flounder prepare
  the target, then map/dig/synthesize/verify, confirm, and report; `run --source`
  is the source-provided entry path for sealed map/dig/synthesize/verify.
- Prefer the dashboard/API control plane for project work so state, daemon
  ownership, live logs, findings, and reports stay durable.
- Preserve the evidence ladder: suspected, locally confirmed, real-target
  reproduced, submission-ready. Do not collapse these into one "bug" bucket.
- Use run health and discovery backlog rows when judging progress: a shallow
  or resource-blocked zero-finding run is not a negative result, and follow-up
  scopes should stay as pending coverage rather than becoming findings.
- Separate machine noise from active work by marking dismissed findings
  `ignored`, never by deleting them.
- Stop with a clear next action or blocker; do not call an audit complete just
  because a command exited.

## Core Audit Modes

Choose the mode from the user's intent before launching anything:

| User intent | Mode | Preparation path | Guardrail |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| "Do a blind audit / test Flounder's capability / no hints" | Blind capability audit | Recommended: `flounder run <project-or-repo-or-package-link>` or a dashboard project with a factual target clue. If source is already staged or external preparation is explicitly unwanted, use `flounder run --source <paths...> --build-root <root>`. | Do not add incident docs, known bug names, exploit theories, or answer-bearing corpus. Official target docs are allowed only as target material, not as a hidden answer. |
| "Here is a suspicious tx/address; find the hack/root cause" | Incident investigation | `flounder run <tx-or-address-or-incident-link>` | Treat the clue as evidence, not as proof. Prepare may fetch chain/source data; confirm by local fork/read-only reproduction only. |
| "Audit this project/repo openly like a white-hat researcher" | Open-world public-source audit | Create a project with source paths when available plus a task/clue naming the project, bounty, repo, package, or deployment, then Run. | Let Prepare collect official docs, scope, deployments, and provenance. Do not use private or answer-bearing material. |
| "Audit this normal bounty / should we submit to this bounty?" | Normal bug bounty | Project with `engagement.kind="bug-bounty"`, source/build/corpus paths when available, and a task/clue naming the public or private program scope. | Keep real-target Confirm when a live target exists. Submit only reproduced or locally confirmed source findings that pass scope, duplicate, known-issue, impact, and payout-readiness gates. |
| "Start this contest / maximize contest bounty speed" | Bug bounty contest | Project with `engagement.kind="bug-bounty-contest"` and contest strategy such as `batchScopes`, `digConcurrency`, `skipRealTargetConfirm`, and `appendMapWhenExhausted`. | Run short settled batches: verify/refute and report before opening the next batch. Source-only local confirmation may be enough when venue rules allow it, but suspected-only findings are not submissions. Use append-map, not remap, when expanding coverage. |

When in doubt: if the user asks to measure Flounder's unaided recall, use blind
capability audit and keep the clue target-only. If the user gives live exploit
evidence, use incident investigation. If the user wants broad public-source or
authorized bug hunting and permits public context collection, use open-world
public-source audit.

## Supporting Workflows

Use these when the user is not asking for a full end-to-end audit:

| User intent | Workflow |
| --- | --- |
| "Just map the surface / show scope inventory" | `flounder map`; do not produce findings. |
| "Dig this file/function/scope deeper" | `flounder audit <region>` or `flounder audit --scope <id>`. |
| "Check these suspected bugs" | `flounder audit --verify <claims.json>`; confirm or refute by execution. |
| "Is this locally confirmed bug real on mainnet/deployment?" | `flounder confirm <run-dir>` or selected project Confirm. |
| "Prepare submission package" | selected Report; include only execution-backed, non-ignored findings. |
| "Triage noisy machine findings" | update tracking: `ignored` for dismissed, `open` to recover. |
| "Run a benchmark / regression set / positive and safe controls" | Create a validated manifest and use `flounder group create --manifest <file>`, then `flounder group start <uuid|name>`. Keep blind material policy explicit, require execution evidence for positives, and require zero confirmed findings on safe/control items. Retry only blocked items with `flounder group retry <work-item-id>`; repeated samples are separate items. |
| "Improve Flounder's harness from Evaluation failures" | Use a finished baseline group, then `flounder experiment create` with an explicit editable-file allowlist. Run the same stable work-item keys on a candidate daemon/workspace, attach that group, and call `flounder experiment evaluate`. Treat `promote` as a review recommendation only; evaluator, safety, merge, and deployment authority remain external. |

## Core Operating Rules

- Use Flounder CLI, dashboard, REST API, or pi extension workflows. Do not edit
  the tracking database directly.
- Confirm authorization and scope before running an audit.
- Keep provider credentials daemon-local. The server stores provider profiles;
  daemons own provider login, API keys, target source, and execution.
- Treat `~/.flounder` as the default product home: tracking DB, run artifacts,
  durable history/build cache, daemon workspace, and daemon-local provider auth
  live there unless the user explicitly passes `--out` or `--workspace`.
- Start with `flounder ui` unless the user already has a control plane running.
  CLI verbs are thin clients of that control plane.
- Use `GET /api` before driving the REST API directly; the catalog is the source
  of truth for endpoint shape.
- Use project-owned docs/specs/audits as corpus. Do not write answer-bearing
  corpus that names the suspected bug, location, or mechanism.
- Do not modify target source in place. Flounder copies a build root into an
  isolated workspace and model-written tests stay inside that workspace.
- Treat `suspected` as unproven. A finding is actionable only when execution
  produced `confirmed-executable`, `confirmed-differential`, or a reproduced
  confirm decision.
- `flounder run <clue>` is the one-command workflow: open-world prepare,
  sealed map/dig/synthesize/verify, open-world confirm, then report generation.
  `flounder run --source`, `map`, and `audit` are sealed discovery phases.
  `prepare` and `confirm` are open-world phases, still under white-hat
  no-broadcast rules.
- Never broadcast transactions, move funds, submit writes, persist access, or
  target systems outside the declared local audit boundary or explicit authorized
  scope.

## First Response Checklist

When a user asks to audit, confirm, verify, report, or inspect Flounder state:

1. Confirm the target source is public, operator-owned, client-authorized, or in
   public bounty scope. If the source boundary is unclear, ask before running.
2. Classify the request into one core audit mode: blind capability audit,
   incident investigation, open-world public-source audit, normal bug bounty,
   or bug bounty contest.
3. Decide the surface:
   - Existing dashboard/API project: use `GET /api`, then project UUID routes.
   - New project or local operator workflow: start/reuse `flounder ui`.
   - Framework-prepared target: prefer task/clue so Flounder can prepare source and official materials.
   - Source-provided target: use `--source` when code is staged or no external preparation is wanted.
4. Check daemon and provider readiness before launching real model work:
   `flounder daemon provider check openai-codex` on the executor machine.
5. Check sandbox readiness before execution-confirming audits:
   `npm run sandbox:build` if the default OCI image is missing.
6. Choose the workflow from the routing table below, launch the smallest
   correct action, then monitor live logs and persisted state.
7. Report the result with project/run ids, phase, evidence status, and next
   action. Include setup blockers distinctly from audit findings.

For repository development or local builds, use Node 24 LTS from `.nvmrc` /
`.node-version`; do not substitute newer experimental Node versions.

## Quickstart For Codex Or Claude Code

1. Check whether Flounder is available:

   ```bash
   flounder --help
   ```

   If it is not available from PATH but the repository is checked out, build it:

   ```bash
   npm install
   npm run build
   node dist/cli.js --help
   ```

   Until the package is installed or linked, replace `flounder` in command
   examples with `node dist/cli.js`.

2. Start or reuse the local control plane:

   ```bash
   flounder ui
   ```

   For a remote executor, mint a token in Settings or with
   `flounder server daemon-token mint`, then run:

   ```bash
   flounder daemon start --server http://<server>:4500 --token <token>
   ```

3. Authenticate every provider that the selected daemon will run:

   ```bash
   flounder daemon provider login openai-codex
   flounder daemon provider check openai-codex
   ```

   For `openai-codex`, this is how the agent asks the user to authenticate.
   Run the login command in the terminal; it prints a browser URL or device-code
   instructions, the user completes the login, and then `check` verifies it. If
   pi already has `openai-codex` in `~/.pi/agent/auth.json`, Flounder imports
   that provider entry into `~/.flounder/agent/auth.json` on login/check.

4. Ensure the execution sandbox is available on the daemon machine. Default
   `auto` mode prefers Apple's `container` runtime on Apple silicon macOS when
   the selected image and sealed network are ready, then falls back to
   Docker-backed OCI when the image is available. For the Docker-backed path,
   install and start Docker or a Docker-compatible runtime, then build the
   default sandbox image from the Flounder repo:

   ```bash
   npm run sandbox:build
   ```

   Curated target-specific images are available for common non-EVM audits:

   ```bash
   npm run sandbox:cairo:build  # flounder-sandbox:cairo, Scarb + Starknet Foundry
   npm run sandbox:ton:build    # flounder-sandbox:ton, TON Blueprint + FunC/Tolk/Tact
   ```

   On Apple silicon macOS daemon hosts, install/start Apple's `container`
   runtime and build or pull the selected image into that runtime to let `auto`
   select it; `--sandbox-backend apple-container` requires that path explicitly.
   If no sandbox engine is available, only use
   `--sandbox-backend host --allow-host-execution` for trusted local smoke tests
   after warning the user that host mode lacks kernel-level filesystem and
   network isolation.

5. Create or reuse a provider profile in Settings. A provider profile selects
   provider, model, and thinking level. Fresh stores seed `openai-codex ·
   gpt-5.6-sol · xhigh` and `claude-code · opus 4.8 max`; the selected daemon still
   needs local auth for every provider the project can use. A project can
   override the profile per phase: prepare, map, dig, confirm.

6. Create or reuse a project. Set:

   - task/clue in the project composer
   - execution daemon
   - default provider profile
   - project directory under the daemon workspace, defaulting to the project UUID
   - source paths
   - build root
   - corpus paths
   - coverage and budget controls

7. Start the audit. Leave **Run after create** checked to launch immediately, or
   use the project **Run** button before the first pipeline run and **Continue**
   afterward. For a clue:

   ```bash
   flounder run <tx-or-address-or-project-or-repo-or-link>
   ```

   For source already on disk:

   ```bash
   flounder run --target <name> --source <paths...> --build-root <root> --corpus <docs...>
   ```

8. Monitor progress from the dashboard, CLI stream, or REST API:

   - current phase: prepare, map, dig, synthesis, verify, confirm, report
   - live activity: `GET /api/runs/:id/log`
   - project state: `GET /api/projects/:uuid`
   - prepare quality: `prepareSummary.quality` is `ready`, `limited`,
     `preparing`, `needs-review`, `missing`, or `invalid`; use
     `prepareSummary.auditReady` as the automation gate. `limited` means the
     audit can continue automatically while recorded trust boundaries or
     material gaps stay visible for later confirm/report decisions. Stop only
     for `prepareSummary.blockingIssues`, `invalid`, or missing usable source.
   - findings: `GET /api/projects/:uuid/findings?tracking=active`
   - ignored findings recovery: `GET /api/projects/:uuid/findings?tracking=ignored`
   - confirm decisions: `GET /api/projects/:uuid/confirm-decisions`
   - run health: `latestRunHealth.status` is `healthy`,
     `needs-coverage`, `needs-resource`, `shallow`, or `infra-failed`
   - discovery backlog: `GET /api/projects/:uuid/backlog?status=open`
     lists coverage gaps, resource requests, and follow-up scopes with
     `actionability`, `action_owner`, and `recommended_action`; treat open rows
     as an agent-owned queue (`agent-runnable`, `agent-resource`, `agent-review`)
     and use `PATCH /api/backlog/:id` to mark rows `resolved`, `ignored`,
     `stale`, or back to `open`

   Project names are display labels. Resolve a project UUID from `POST /api/projects`
   or `GET /api/projects`; do not build a project URL from the name.

9. Decide the next action using the rules below. Do not call the task complete
   just because one run ended.

## Fast Recipes

### Blind Capability Audit

Use this when the user wants no hints, no incident context, or a
framework-capability check.

Recommended target-prepared path:

```bash
flounder run <project-or-repo-or-package-link>
```

Existing source path:

```bash
flounder run --target <name> --source <paths...> --build-root <root> --corpus <user-supplied-docs...>
```

- Leave `--corpus` empty unless the user supplied official docs/specs as part of
  the blind package.
- Do not use incident reports, known bug names, exploit theories, hand-written
  scope notes that point at a suspected bug, or answer-bearing corpus.
- Judge the result by evidence status and coverage: mapped scopes, audited
  scopes, suspected findings, locally confirmed findings, pending scopes.
- A negative result is "no confirmed finding in covered scope", not proof the
  target is safe.

### Incident Investigation From A Transaction Or Address

Use this when the user gives a suspicious transaction, address, exploit link, or
asks "why was this hacked?"

```bash
flounder run <tx-or-address-or-incident-link>
```

- Let Prepare collect deployed source, chain facts, official project material,
  and real-target confirmation requirements.
- Keep the incident clue factual. Do not write a theory of the bug into corpus.
- Confirm the root cause with attacker-real local reproduction, usually a local
  fork or source-level replay. Never broadcast or write to a live system.
- The answer should explain the exploited invariant, attacker path, affected
  component, and whether the finding is reproduced, not-reproduced, or still
  suspected.

### Open-World Public-Source Audit

Use this when the user wants Flounder to actively collect official public
context, deployments, package metadata, docs, or bounty scope when available.
Source paths are useful when already available, but they are not what defines
the scenario. A public bounty is a priority and submission-path signal, not a
prerequisite for local sealed audit.

1. Start or reuse `flounder ui`.
2. Create a project with:
   - local source/build/corpus paths if available;
   - a task/clue naming the project, repo, bounty page, deployment, or package;
   - an online daemon;
   - a provider profile such as `openai-codex · gpt-5.6-sol · xhigh`.
3. Leave **Run after create** checked when the user wants immediate execution.
4. Monitor `GET /api/runs/:id/log` and `GET /api/projects/:uuid`.
5. Treat `limited` prepare as audit-ready unless it has blocking issues; carry
   caveats forward to verify/confirm/report decisions.
6. Use official/public materials only; do not add private notes or answer-bearing
   docs that name a suspected bug.

### Normal Bug Bounty

Use this when the target is a normal public or private bounty program and a live
target may need real-world reproduction.

1. Create a project with `config.engagement.kind="bug-bounty"`.
2. Provide local source/build/corpus paths when available, plus a task/clue
   naming the official program, scope, deployment, or package.
3. Let Prepare collect public scope, deployments, provenance, and known-issue
   leads.
4. Run sealed map/dig/synthesize/verify for local proof.
5. Run Confirm for locally confirmed findings when live-target reproduction is
   required or useful.
6. Submit only findings that pass scope, duplicate, known-issue, impact,
   payout-readiness, and white-hat disclosure gates.

### Bug Bounty Contest

Use this when the venue is a time-limited audit contest with source, rules, and
a report format.

1. Create a project with `config.engagement.kind="bug-bounty-contest"`.
2. Configure contest strategy to favor fast settled loops, for example
   `batchScopes:10`, `digConcurrency:5`, `skipRealTargetConfirm:true`, and
   `appendMapWhenExhausted:true` when the rules are source-only.
3. Before opening more scopes, settle existing candidates through verify/refute
   and report. Contest mode is speed-oriented, but suspected-only findings
   still do not meet the submission bar.
4. Use duplicate tracking against already submitted issues and local findings
   before submitting a new report.
5. When mapped scopes are exhausted, append-map to add novel scopes while
   preserving audited status, submitted findings, duplicate links, and reports.
   Do not remap unless the operator intentionally wants a fresh inventory.
6. Watch contest stop-review signals: elapsed review window, exhausted
   inventory, recent low-yield batches, duplicate rate, report backlog, and open
   resource requests.

### Continue An Existing Project

1. Resolve the project UUID from `GET /api/projects`.
2. Use the project **Continue** action, or from the CLI:

   ```bash
   flounder continue --project <uuid|name>
   ```

   This is the same project pipeline action as the UI Continue button; it queues
   `verb:"run"` and lets the control plane continue from stored project state.
3. If shelling through the REST API directly, use:

   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:4500/api/projects/<uuid>/runs \
     -H 'content-type: application/json' \
     -d '{"verb":"run"}'
   ```

4. Inspect `latestRunHealth`, `backlogCounts`, and open backlog rows before
   drawing conclusions. Treat open Next Actions as work for the agent to
   resolve or route before opening unrelated fresh coverage; ask the operator
   only for explicit credentials, authorization, or unavailable external
   resources. Continue coverage or prioritize follow-up scopes for
   `needs-coverage`; do not treat `shallow` as a meaningful negative result.
5. If many mapped scopes are pending, prefer continuing coverage before drawing
   a negative conclusion.

### Project Setup And Housekeeping

Use this when the user asks why a project cannot run, how to clean up the
project rail, or how to recover archived work.

- Open the project setup disclosure first when the overview reports setup
  attention. Fix daemon selection, provider auth, source paths, or prepared
  material blockers before launching new work.
- Treat the Project setup disclosure as the home for the stored project clue
  and prepare caveats. Do not expect the clue to appear as a separate dashboard
  card; inspect setup before assuming Prepare did not receive context.
- If open `resource-request` backlog rows explain a setup limitation, first let
  the agent inspect the blocker and retry safe setup work. Ask the operator only
  for explicit credentials, authorization, or unavailable external resources,
  then mark handled rows `resolved` or non-actionable rows `ignored`.
- Pin active projects that need daily attention; archive dormant projects from
  the project card menu. Archiving hides the project from the rail, clears pin,
  and keeps runs, scopes, findings, and reports.
- Recover archived projects from Settings -> Archived Projects.
- Drag ordering is for active projects only; default ordering is newest-created
  first, with pinned projects before unpinned projects.

### Findings Triage

Use this when the user is reviewing machine-reported bugs.

- Start in the Active findings view; filter by project when working one audit.
- Keep audit status (`suspected`, `confirmed-*`, `refuted`) separate from
  tracking state (`open`, `triaging`, `submitted`, `ignored`, etc.).
- Mark human-dismissed false positives as `ignored`; do not delete them.
- Use the Ignored view to recover dismissed findings and set them back to
  `open` if new evidence appears.
- Generate reports only for reproduced real-target bugs, or locally confirmed
  source-provided audit bugs when real-target confirmation is not required.

### Verify, Confirm, And Report Selected Findings

- Suspected finding from JSON: `flounder audit --verify <file> --source ...`
  or the equivalent `flounder verify <file> --source ...`.
- Selected project findings: use More actions -> Verify/Confirm/Report, or
  pass `findingId` / `findingIds` to `POST /api/projects/:uuid/runs`.
- Regenerate only specific reports with `{"verb":"report","findingIds":[...]}`.
- Regenerate every current reportable finding with
  `{"verb":"report","regenerateReports":true}` or
  `flounder report --project <uuid|name> --all`.
- Report without `findingIds` generates only missing formal reports.
- CLI report generation uses the same project worklist:
  `flounder report --project <uuid|name>` for missing reports and
  `flounder report --project <uuid|name> --finding <id>` for selected
  regeneration.
- Mark a human-dismissed machine finding as `ignored`; recover it later from
  `tracking=ignored` by changing it back to `open`.

## Workflow Map

Open only the references needed for the current task:

- exact CLI, REST, provider, daemon, budget, output, and pi extension details:
  [reference/commands.md](reference/commands.md)
- Solidity/EVM and ZK examples:
  [reference/examples.md](reference/examples.md)
- dashboard, project lifecycle, run phases, discovery backlog, and artifact model:
  [reference/product.md](reference/product.md)
- white-hat policy, sandbox boundary, and evidence ladder:
  [reference/safety.md](reference/safety.md)

## Task Routing

| User intent | Use |
| --- | --- |
| "Blind audit this target / test framework capability" | Blind capability audit: prefer `flounder run <target-clue>`; use `flounder run --source ... --build-root ...` when source is already staged or no external preparation is wanted |
| "Find why this tx/address was hacked" | Incident investigation: `flounder run <tx-or-address-or-incident-link>` |
| "Audit this repo/source openly" | Open-world public-source audit: project with source paths plus task/clue, then Run |
| "Map the attack surface first" | `flounder map`, then inspect scopes and run `flounder audit --scope ...` |
| "Dig this file/function/region" | `flounder audit <region> --source ... --build-root ...` |
| "Verify this suspected bug" | Write a claims JSON and run `flounder verify <file>` or `flounder audit --verify <file>` |
| "Continue coverage" | Use project Continue or audit pending scopes from the inventory; inspect discovery backlog first for resource blockers or follow-up scopes |
| "Confirm whether this is real" | `flounder confirm <run-dir>` or project/finding Confirm in the UI |
| "Collect bugs for disclosure" | Read findings, selected reports, confirm decisions, and artifacts; return only execution-backed items |
| "Ignore this false positive" | Set finding tracking to `ignored`; do not delete it |
| "Bring back ignored findings" | Filter `tracking=ignored`, then set selected rows back to `open` |
| "Regenerate reports" | Use `flounder report --project <uuid|name> --finding <id>` or the report action with selected `findingIds` |

## Deciding The Next Action

- No daemon online: create/connect a daemon before launching jobs.
- Daemon online but provider check fails: run `flounder daemon provider login`
  or set daemon-local provider credentials, then check again.
- Sandbox says no backend is available: on Apple silicon macOS, install/start
  Apple's `container` runtime and build or pull the image into that runtime, or
  install/start Docker on the daemon and run `npm run sandbox:build`. Host
  fallback still needs explicit trusted-local approval.
- Project has no provider profile or daemon: configure those before creating a
  run.
- Run is queued and no daemon can claim it: check the project's selected daemon.
- Run is running: watch `GET /api/runs/:id/log` and the project phase, not only
  aggregate counts.
- Prepare quality is `limited`: continue automatically unless the user asked to
  perfect materials first; preserve `prepareSummary.caveats`, `gaps`, and
  `realTarget` for verify, confirm, and reports.
- Prepare quality is `needs-review`, `missing`, or `invalid`: read
  `prepareSummary.blockingIssues`, `issues`, `gaps`, and `realTarget`. Repair
  only hard blockers such as contaminated answer-bearing material, invalid
  output, empty prepared source, or no usable source; otherwise continue with
  caveats instead of requiring manual review.
- Map is done but many high-score scopes are pending: continue the audit or
  prioritize scopes.
- Latest run health is `needs-resource`: inspect open `resource-request` rows,
  have the agent retry safe toolchain, sandbox, dependency, source, or auth setup
  where possible, and ask the operator only for explicit credentials,
  authorization, or unavailable external resources. Mark handled rows
  `resolved`, then rerun the blocked phase. Prepare and toolchain warm-up can
  create these rows even when the model did not write `resource_requests.json`;
  treat them as product-owned setup work, not as audit findings.
- Latest run health is `needs-coverage`: continue pending scopes or prioritize
  follow-up scopes from the backlog. Do not ask the model to "report more bugs"
  as a substitute for coverage.
- Latest run health is `shallow`: treat the run as inconclusive; inspect logs
  and rerun or fix setup before summarizing.
- Discovery backlog has open Next Actions: let the agent resolve or route them
  first. Coverage rows continue coverage, append map coverage, or prioritize the
  referenced scopes; setup rows retry safe local setup; routing rows are
  inspected and turned into the right safe workflow action. They are not findings
  and should not appear in a bug list unless a later execution-backed audit
  confirms one.
- Findings are only `suspected`: make the target buildable and run verify or
  dig again.
- Findings are confirmed locally but not reproduced: run confirm.
- Contest project with `skipRealTargetConfirm=true`: real-target Confirm may be
  intentionally skipped, but verify/refute and report eligibility are still
  required before submission.
- Contest inventory exhausted: use append-map/Continue to expand novel scopes
  without losing prior scope status or submitted/duplicate finding history.
- Machine-reported finding is manually dismissed: set tracking to `ignored`;
  recover it later from the Ignored filter by changing tracking back to `open`.
- Confirm decision is `not-reproduced`: treat it as not submission-ready unless
  the failure is a known environment limitation and the user approves more work.
- Confirm decision is `submit-candidate`: collect the bug package and stop
  further exploitation.
- No findings and material coverage is low: improve source/build/corpus setup or
  continue pending scopes before concluding.

## Common Errors And Recovery

| Symptom | Likely cause | Recovery |
| --- | --- | --- |
| No daemon can claim a queued job | Project is pinned to an offline daemon | Start that daemon or edit the project daemon. |
| Provider auth missing | Credentials live on daemon, not server | Run `flounder daemon provider login <provider>` and then `check`. |
| Docker-backed OCI sandbox unavailable | Default image missing or Docker stopped | Start Docker and run `npm run sandbox:build`; host fallback needs explicit trusted-local approval. |
| Apple container sandbox unavailable | Apple `container` is not installed/started, the selected image is missing from that runtime, or the internal sealed network cannot be created | Run `container system start` and build or pull the image into Apple's runtime; `auto` falls back to Docker when that path is not ready. |
| `prepareSummary.quality=limited` | Source is usable but has caveats | Continue unless blocking issues exist; preserve caveats for confirm/report. |
| `prepareSummary.quality=invalid/missing` | No usable staged source or contaminated material | Repair prepare inputs before audit. |
| Verify rejects selected findings for material drift | New Prepare changed the current material boundary | Re-select current findings or pass the explicit expert override only after checking drift. |
| Confirm returns `not-reproduced` | PoC was not attacker-real on the real target, or environment is incomplete | Treat as not submission-ready unless the user approves more reproduction work. |
| Report action says no findings are missing reports | All reportable rows already have formal reports, or selected rows are not reproduced/confirmed | Use `flounder report --project <uuid|name> --all` to regenerate existing reports, select eligible findings, or inspect Active/Ignored tracking filters. |
| Node native crash during repo tooling | Unsupported Node version | Use Node 24 LTS from `.nvmrc` / `.node-version`. |

## Collecting Bugs

For every bug candidate, collect:

- project and run id
- title, location, scope id, and status
- why the property matters
- exact command evidence or `command_id`
- PoC files or test path
- differential result, if any
- refutation or appeal result, if any
- confirm decision: reproduced, not-reproduced, submit-candidate, needs-human,
  or drop
- report path and artifact paths
- remaining human gates: bounty scope, duplicate/known issue, embargo, or
  disclosure venue

Do not present a list of model suspicions as bugs. Separate confirmed findings,
suspected findings, refuted findings, and reproduced submit candidates.

## Completion Snapshot

The task is not complete until the agent can report:

- Flounder control plane is reachable, or a clear setup blocker is documented.
- The execution daemon is selected and online.
- Every selected provider profile is authenticated on the daemon.
- The project has source paths, a build root, and corpus paths appropriate for
  the requested audit.
- Prepared materials are `ready` or `limited`; if limited, every caveat needed
  for verify, confirm, or report decisions is called out as a known limitation.
- The audit run reached a terminal state or a meaningful blocker.
- Latest run health and open discovery backlog rows are summarized when present.
- Scope coverage is summarized: mapped, audited, pending, deferred.
- Findings are grouped by status.
- Confirmed findings have been sent through confirm when real-target
  reproduction is required.
- Ignored findings are separated from the active worklist and remain recoverable.
- Reproduced or locally confirmed source-provided audit bugs have selected
  reports when disclosure packaging is requested.
- Submit candidates include evidence and artifact paths.
- Non-submittable items are labeled as suspected, refuted, not-reproduced, or
  needs-human with the reason.

## High-Risk Defaults

- Do not run against a target without explicit authorization.
- Do not use host execution for model-generated tests unless the user explicitly
  approves trusted-local fallback after being told it lacks kernel-level
  filesystem and network isolation.
- Do not treat a mocked trusted component as attacker-real capability.
- Do not conclude from "matches upstream" or "looks standard".
- Do not silently lower model or thinking settings.
- Do not bury daemon/provider setup failures as audit failures.
- Do not submit or disclose without a reproduced, scoped, private report.
