## Product Surfaces

| Surface | Use |
| --- | --- |
| `flounder ui` | Local control plane, dashboard, REST API, SQLite store, and optional co-located daemon |
| `flounder daemon start` | Execution plane that claims jobs, owns target source and provider credentials, and reports progress |
| CLI verbs | Thin clients of the control plane; they enqueue tracked jobs and stream daemon activity |
| REST API | Agent-drivable surface; start with `GET /api` |
| pi extension | Registers `flounder_prepare`, `flounder_run`, `flounder_map`, `flounder_audit`, and `flounder_confirm` when loaded through pi |

## Setup Commands

```bash
flounder ui                 # dashboard at http://127.0.0.1:4500 plus co-located daemon
flounder ui --no-daemon     # control plane only
flounder server daemon-token mint [name]
flounder daemon start --server http://<server>:4500 --token <token>
flounder daemon provider list
flounder daemon provider login openai-codex
flounder daemon provider check openai-codex
```

Provider auth is daemon-local. The server stores provider profiles and queues
jobs; the daemon executes jobs and owns credentials. For `openai-codex`, run
`flounder daemon provider login openai-codex` to trigger the user-facing OAuth
flow; the command prints a browser URL or device-code instructions. If pi
already has `openai-codex` in `~/.pi/agent/auth.json`, Flounder imports that
provider entry into `~/.flounder/agent/auth.json` on login/check.

CLI naming convention:

- Workflow verbs stay top-level: `flounder run`, `flounder continue`,
  `flounder map`, `flounder audit`, `flounder verify`,
  `flounder confirm`, and `flounder report`.
- Server/control-plane resource commands live under `flounder server ...`.
- `flounder daemon ...` commands run on the daemon machine and can touch local
  provider auth, workspace paths, and executor settings. Start executors with
  `flounder daemon start --server <url> --token <token>`.
- Resource commands use noun/action form, matching provider commands:
  `flounder server finding list`, `flounder server run list`,
  `flounder server daemon-token mint`, and
  `flounder daemon provider list/login/check`.
- Do not expose `db` to users; the SQLite store is an implementation detail.

## Audit Verbs

| Verb | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `flounder prepare <clue>` | Open-world acquisition before map: tx/address/project/repo/link -> staged source, corpus, dependency closure, and deployment match |
| `flounder run <clue>` | One-command pipeline: prepare -> sealed map/dig/synthesize/verify -> confirm -> report unless disabled |
| `flounder continue --project <uuid\|name>` | Continue a stored project pipeline; CLI equivalent of the UI Continue button |
| `flounder run --source <paths...> --target <name>` | Source-provided sealed audit: map -> dig -> synthesize -> verify |
| `flounder map --target <name> --source <paths...>` | Enumerate and persist scope inventory only |
| `flounder audit <region> --source ...` | Deep-audit one region |
| `flounder audit --scope <id,...> --source ...` | Deep-audit selected inventory scopes |
| `flounder audit --verify <file> --source ...` | Confirm or refute suspected findings by execution |
| `flounder verify <file> --source ...` | Alias for `audit --verify`; confirm or refute suspected findings by local execution |
| `flounder confirm <run-dir> --source <paths...>` | Open-world reproduction and submit/no-submit decision sheet |
| `flounder report --project <uuid\|name> [--finding <id>...] [--all]` | Generate missing formal reports, or regenerate selected/all reportable findings |
| `flounder history import-run --target <name> --run <dir>` | Import an existing run directory into tracked history |

## Materials

| Flag | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `--source <paths...>` | Code under audit. Point at readable source; pair with `--build-root` for buildability. |
| `--build-root <dir>` | Buildable workspace copied into the sandbox. Required for strong execution confirmation on real projects. |
| `--corpus <paths...>` | Project-owned specs, whitepapers, design docs, prior audits, or factual incident briefs. Context, not answers. |
| `--target <name>` | Project/run artifact key. |
| `--config <file>` | Optional JSON profile. CLI flags override it. |
| `--scope-note <text>` | One-line authorized-scope hint. |

## Engagement Config

Set `config.engagement.kind` on dashboard/API projects when the reportability
rules matter:

- `standard`: default authorized review.
- `bug-bounty`: normal bounty work; keep real-target Confirm when a live target
  exists and gate reports on scope, duplicate, known-issue, impact, payout, and
  disclosure readiness.
- `bug-bounty-contest`: time-limited contest work; run short settled batches,
  optionally skip real-target Confirm when source-only rules allow it, and
  append-map novel scopes when the inventory is exhausted.

Contest strategy fields:

```json
{
  "engagement": {
    "kind": "bug-bounty-contest",
    "strategy": {
      "batchScopes": 10,
      "digConcurrency": 5,
      "skipRealTargetConfirm": true,
      "appendMapWhenExhausted": true
    }
  }
}
```

## Coverage And Budget Controls

Defaults are designed for real audits: `--max-scopes` defaults to 30, dig samples
default to 1, dig concurrency defaults to 1, and map/dig can run until the model
is done unless capped by launch config.

| Flag | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `--quick` | `run` only: one breadth pass instead of map -> dig |
| `--map-steps <n>` | Cap map phase |
| `--dig-steps <n>` | Cap each scope's dig |
| `--dig-samples <n>` | Independent dig passes per scope; findings are unioned |
| `--dig-concurrency <n>` | Deep-audit multiple scopes in isolated workspaces |
| `--max-scopes <n>` | Scopes audited in the next dig batch; default 30 |
| `--remap` | Re-enumerate scope inventory instead of resuming |
| `--append-map`, `--expand-map` | Ask MAP to append novel scopes while preserving existing scope status |
| `--append-map-seed <path>` | Add prior scope inventories as covered-reference material for append-map |

## Sandbox And Network

| Flag | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `--sandbox-backend <auto,oci,apple-container,host>` | Default `auto`; Apple container is preferred on Apple silicon macOS when ready, otherwise Docker-backed OCI |
| `--sandbox-image <image>` | OCI image for sandboxed commands |
| `--allow-host-execution` | Trusted-local opt-in fallback only |
| `--prepare-network <none,enabled>` | Dependency warm-up/build network policy |
| `--confirm-network <none,enabled>` | Prepare/confirm open-world network policy |
| `--no-prepare` | Skip toolchain warm-up |
| `--prepare-timeout-ms <n>` | Warm-up timeout |

Real execution-confirming audits use a sandbox engine plus a built or pulled
sandbox image. Default `auto` mode prefers Apple's `container` runtime on Apple
silicon macOS when the selected image and sealed network are ready, then falls
back to Docker-backed OCI. For the Docker path, build the default image with
`npm run sandbox:build`.

On Apple silicon macOS daemon hosts, `auto` can select Apple's `container`
runtime after it is installed, started, and has the selected sandbox image
available. Use `--sandbox-backend apple-container` to require that path
explicitly.

Build curated target-specific images when a bounty target needs native
confirmation tools that are not in the baseline image:

```bash
npm run sandbox:cairo:build  # flounder-sandbox:cairo, Scarb + Starknet Foundry
npm run sandbox:ton:build    # flounder-sandbox:ton, TON Blueprint + FunC/Tolk/Tact
```

Then pass the selected image explicitly:

```bash
flounder run --source ./src --build-root . --sandbox-image flounder-sandbox:cairo
flounder run --source ./contracts --build-root . --sandbox-image flounder-sandbox:ton
```

Host execution is only for trusted local smoke tests and fixtures:

```bash
flounder run --source ./src --build-root . --sandbox-backend host --allow-host-execution
```

Host mode keeps the copied workspace and isolated `HOME` / package caches, but
it does not provide kernel-level network or filesystem isolation.

Prepare and toolchain warm-up failures are surfaced as `resource-request`
backlog rows with a diagnostic and retry command. A `needs-resource` run should
make the agent inspect the blocker and retry safe sandbox, toolchain, dependency,
source, or fork setup where possible. Ask the operator only for explicit
credentials, authorization, or unavailable external resources, then mark the row
resolved.

Sealed `run --source`, `map`, and `audit` inspection/confirmation commands
should not use public network access. `prepare` and `confirm` may fetch, fork,
search, and read under the white-hat command policy, but they must not
broadcast or write to live systems.

## Provider Profiles

The dashboard stores provider profiles:

- provider id, such as `openai-codex`
- model, such as `gpt-5.5`
- thinking level, such as `xhigh`
- optional role defaults

Projects select a default provider profile and may override it per phase:
prepare, map, dig, confirm. The selected daemon must authenticate every provider
profile the project can use.

Fresh stores seed starter profiles named `openai-codex · gpt-5.5 · xhigh` and
`claude-code · opus 4.8 max`.

## REST API

Start with:

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:4500/api
```

Common agent calls:

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:4500/api/projects
curl http://127.0.0.1:4500/api/providers
curl http://127.0.0.1:4500/api/daemons
curl http://127.0.0.1:4500/api/projects/<uuid>
curl 'http://127.0.0.1:4500/api/projects/<uuid>/backlog?status=open'
curl 'http://127.0.0.1:4500/api/projects/<uuid>/findings?tracking=active'
curl 'http://127.0.0.1:4500/api/projects/<uuid>/findings?tracking=ignored'
curl http://127.0.0.1:4500/api/projects/<uuid>/confirm-decisions
curl http://127.0.0.1:4500/api/runs/<id>/log
```

Discovery backlog rows can be filtered with
`kind=coverage-gap|resource-request|followup-scope` and
`status=open|resolved|stale|ignored|all`. Rows include `actionability`,
`action_owner`, `recommended_action`, and `primary_action_label`: agents should
advance `agent-runnable` coverage rows, resolve `agent-resource` setup rows when
safe local work can do so, and route `agent-review` rows to the next safe
workflow action. Ask the operator only for explicit credentials, authorization,
or unavailable external resources. Update operator state without deleting
provenance:

```bash
curl -X PATCH http://127.0.0.1:4500/api/backlog/<id> \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{"status":"resolved"}'
```

Creating a project requires both a provider profile and a daemon. `dir` is the
project directory under the daemon workspace; source and corpus paths are
relative to that directory.

```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:4500/api/projects \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{"name":"p","providerId":1,"daemonId":1,"dir":"p","sourcePaths":["."],"buildRoot":".","corpusPaths":["docs/specs"],"config":{"prepareClue":"audit this project","maxScopes":30,"engagement":{"kind":"bug-bounty"}}}'
```

If `dir` is omitted, the project directory under the selected daemon workspace
defaults to the project UUID.

Starting a run:

```bash
PROJECT_UUID=<uuid-from-project-create-or-list>
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:4500/api/projects/$PROJECT_UUID/runs \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{"verb":"run"}'
```

Selected report regeneration:

```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:4500/api/projects/$PROJECT_UUID/runs \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{"verb":"report","findingIds":[123,456]}'

curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:4500/api/projects/$PROJECT_UUID/runs \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{"verb":"report","regenerateReports":true}'
```

CLI equivalent:

```bash
flounder report --project $PROJECT_UUID
flounder report --project $PROJECT_UUID --finding 123 --finding 456
flounder report --project $PROJECT_UUID --all
```

Without `--finding` or `--all`, `flounder report` generates only missing formal
reports. `--finding` regenerates selected reports even when a report already
exists; `--all` regenerates every current reportable finding.

## Outputs

Each audit run writes:

- `audit_scopes.json`
- `audit_findings.json`
- `audit_hypotheses.json`
- `audit_command_runs.json`
- `run_health.json`
- `coverage_gaps.json`
- `resource_requests.json`
- `followup_scopes.json`
- `audit_report.md`
- `summary.json`
- `events.jsonl`
- `calls/*.json`

Each confirm run writes:

- `confirm_provenance.json`
- `confirm_decision.json`
- `confirm_report.md`
- `confirm_equivalence.json`
- `confirm_transcript.json`

Each report run writes formal finding reports back to the tracking store and may
also expose allowlisted `report_<finding>.md` artifacts.

The tracking store records metadata and artifact paths; run artifacts remain
private by default.

Default local state is under `~/.flounder`: `flounder.db` for tracking,
`history/` for durable memory/build cache, `agent/auth.json` for daemon-local
provider auth, and `workspace/` for daemon project directories. System temp is
only for short-lived scratch.

## Pi Extension

When loaded through pi, Flounder registers:

- `flounder_prepare`: open-world target acquisition from a clue
- `flounder_run`: with a clue, prepare -> sealed map/dig/synthesize/verify -> confirm -> report; with source paths, sealed map/dig/synthesize/verify source audit
- `flounder_map`: sealed scope inventory only
- `flounder_audit`: sealed dig, pinned region audit, selected scope audit, or inline finding verification
- `flounder_confirm`: open-world reproduction for a finished run

The dashboard/API path is still the recommended agent surface for project,
daemon, provider, live activity, and finding lifecycle management.
